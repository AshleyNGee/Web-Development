    <p>Hi i'm Ashley, i am a graphic design major who wants to be a UX designer. 
        I am currently in a relationship, and we have been together for 2 months now.  
        I am a full-time student on-campus. I am taking this class to get a better understanding of coding and website development. I hope to easily understand this course and learn a lot. 
        I like to play all types of games and I enjoy all outdoor outings.I love to swim, I have been swimming since I was eight. I grew up in Houston, TX. Something I like about BYUI is the people who are erally kind. 
        I can make friends quite easily here. I have been a member of the church since I was 5 and my favorite scripture is Helaman 5:12. thank you for viewing. </p>
